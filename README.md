## Setup

Download all the necessary node modules with `npm install`

## Running Client

Use the command `npm start` to launch the server and then navigate to the supplied address

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server

For now the `pixi.js` file has to be in the game folder until I set up WebPack

## Running Server

Use the command `npm run starts` to start the socket server
